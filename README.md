# Origami Renderer
In JavaScript with threejs. Take a look in the [LOG.md](https://github.com/georgiee/origami/blob/master/LOG.md) for what's happening at the moment.


Heavily based on [Origami Editor 3d (Java)](http://origamieditor3d.sourceforge.net/userguide/en/index.html)
as I'm porting, converting, refactoring with another goal in mind. I want to animate it later. This won't be an editor
for casual users.
